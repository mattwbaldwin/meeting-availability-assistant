# Privacy Policy

**Meeting Availability Assistant** is designed to help users propose meeting times directly from Gmail.

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, store, sell, or transmit any personal data.

All email content, detected times, and calendar availability checks are processed **locally in the user’s browser**.

## Calendar Access

If enabled, the extension uses Google Calendar access solely to check availability for the purpose of suggesting meeting times.  
No calendar data is stored, logged, or transmitted to external servers.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.

## Remote Services

The current version of the extension does **not** send email content or personal data to external servers or APIs.

Future versions may offer optional features that use external services; those features will be clearly disclosed and require user opt-in.

## Changes

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.
